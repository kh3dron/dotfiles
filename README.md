all my shit just how I like it! No `nix` or `gnu stow` funny business this is raw shellfish.

- `./configure` to put all this repo's configs in their respective places. Note that these will overwrite all existing files, so use carefully if you're not me.
- In the `.gitignore` is a `work.sh` file that will be appended to the end of the `.zshrc`. Secret values are in there.
